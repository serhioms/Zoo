/** Race Conditions and Spin Locks
 * 
 * A race condition occurs when two threads try to access the same object at the same time, and the
 * behavior of the code changes depending on who wins.
 *  
 * I'll show you how to cure a race condition with the Simple_notifying_queue class, which
 * demonstrates a blocking queue used by one thread to notify another when some event occurs.
 * The basic notion is that a thread that tries to dequeue from an empty queue will block until some other
 * thread puts something in the queue.
 * 
 * The queue is implemented as a ring buffer...
 * 
 * The wait() call doesn't return until the method that calls notify() releases the monitor.

			/* That innocuous while loop (Listing 2.1, line 22) is pretty important.
			 * First, consider what would
			 * happen if you replaced the notify() call with a call to notifyAll(). Imagine that several threads were
			 * simultaneously trying to dequeue something from the same empty queue. All of these threads are
			 * blocked on a single condition variable, waiting for an enqueue operation to be executed. When
			 * enqueue() sets the condition to true by calling notifyAll(), the threads are all released from the wait
			 * (moved from a suspended to a runnable state). The released threads all try to acquire the monitor at
			 * once, but only one wins and gets the mutex, dequeueing the (one-and-only) object.
			 * 
			 * That's one of the reasons why we need that while
			 * statement—the other threads will all loop back up, notice that the queue is empty, and go back to
			 * waiting. This sort of loop is called a spin lock.
